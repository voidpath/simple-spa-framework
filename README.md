# simple-spa-framework
A simple framework for creating a Single Page Application (SPA) that can be hosted on any static server (without Node.js)!

## Documentation
The framework is very versatile while maintaining a barebones structure. The latest documentation for using it can be found at the Voidpath Developer website (projects.dev.voidpath.com)
